PetPal frontend (Node JS/ React JS/ Jest/ MongoDB/ Express/ Mongoose).
A full stack web application, designed to help dog owners find play dates for their dogs.(Tinder style interface)

Link to recorded demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfyzbo2OnP0

-Implemented TTD for backend with Jest testing framework.
-Utilized Socket.io to implement real time functionality for messaging and matches.
-MVC design pattern and RESTful routes.
-Employed validation using JWT.

To test this application;
1. Please first navigate to the backend repository, link below, and set that up.
-backend link: https://github.com/hs21hs/first-chat-project
2. In the terminal enter "npm start". 
3. In order to test messaging run "npm start" in a seperate terminal and login with a second user.
4. Note- it is suggested to login with seeded user "l@hotmail.com", and to test chat features login a second time with "d@hotmail.com". Password for both users is "default123".
(if you choose to sign up a new user and do not provide an image url it will give you a default profile picture).

Thank You!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
